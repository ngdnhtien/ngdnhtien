My name is *Nguyễn Đình Tiến*. You can call me Terrence. 

I was born in [Hue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huế), and raised in [Binh Duong](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thủ_Dầu_Một). I lived in Ho Chi Minh City for a while, before moving to Hanoi. For those who wonder, the majority of my friends believe I speak a mixture of Southern-Northern accent, though my active vocabulary spans the three regions.

As part of [Hung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=L_NTUcoAAAAJ)’s group, my research interests centre around cQED architecture for quantum information processing, specifically high-dimensional control and characterization of superconducting transmon circuits.

I'm currently drifting into the realm of quantum error correction where I study how a potential bosonic code based on odd rotational symmetry can be constructed as a visiting student in the group of [Valerio Scarani](https://sites.google.com/site/valeriosgroup/group-members?authuser=0).
