My name is Nguyễn Đình Tiến. You can call me Terrence Nguyen. 

I was born in [Hue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huế), and raised in [Binh Duong](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thủ_Dầu_Một). I lived in Ho Chi Minh City for a while, before moving to Hanoi. For those who wonder, the majority of my friends believe I speak a mixture of Southern-Northern accents, though my active vocabulary spans the three regions.

### Academic 

I was once a student of the [PFIEV program](http://www.pfiev.hcmut.edu.vn/pfiev/) at [HCMUT](https://hcmut.edu.vn/en), before making a quantum leap to become a physics student at [VNU University of Science](http://english.hus.vnu.edu.vn).

As part of [Hung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=L_NTUcoAAAAJ)’s group, my research interests centre around circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture for quantum information processing, specifically high-dimensional control and characterization of superconducting transmon circuits.

### Outreach

I completed my first term as the Head of Academic Affairs at HUS Physics Club (2020-2022). We create engaging physics-related forums, build coherent communities, and promote the love for physics.
