## About

[ngdnhtien](https://github.com/ngdnhtien) is Nguy·ªÖn ƒê√¨nh Ti·∫øn. I am a physics undergraduate and guitar player. If I have something clever to share, I scribble it down on my [blog](https://ngdnhtien.com). My favourite topics are quantum computation & quantum information, Haruki Murakami, and Coldplay. When I‚Äôm not doodling equations or coding, you may find me grinding a book at one of those The Coffee House stores.

I spend one third of my daily time budget playing around with quantum objects.
