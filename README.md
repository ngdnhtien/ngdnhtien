# Greetings from Hanoi!🇻🇳

### About

[ngdnhtien](https://github.com/ngdnhtien) is another way of writing my full name, Nguyễn Đình Tiến. I am a physics undergraduate and guitar player. If I have something clever to share, I scribble it down on my [blog](https://ngdnhtien.github.io). My favourite topics are quantum computation & quantum information, Haruki Murakami, and Coldplay. When I’m not doodling equations or coding, you may find me grinding a book at one of those The Coffee House stores.

### github/ngdnhtien

I spend one third of my daily time budget playing around with quantum objects.

+ [PulsatingPulseLab](https://github.com/ngdnhtien/PulsatingPulseLab) - My quantum mechanic shop. See what I did there? Heh! I calibrate quantum objects there.
