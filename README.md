Hi there! My name is Nguyễn Đình Tiến, thanks for stopping by. If you’re not falimiar with Vietnamese pronounciation, simply call me *Heisenberg* – that’s just fine. 

I was born in Hue, and raised in Binh Duong. I lived in Ho Chi Minh City for a while, before moving to Hanoi.

## Academic

I am a physics major at [VNU-HN University of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNU_University_of_Science). My current field of interest is quantum computing. As of 2021, I have been working around superconducting qubits, both theoretical and experimental aspects, and working my way up from there.

## Outreach

I am serving my first term as the Head of Academic Affairs at [HUS Physics Club](https://husphysicsclub.org). We create engaging physics-related activities, build coherent communities, and promote the love for physics.
