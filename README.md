My name is Nguyễn Đình Tiến. If you’re not falimiar with Vietnamese pronounciation, simply call me *Heisenberg* – that’s just fine. I was born in Hue, and raised in Binh Duong. I lived in Ho Chi Minh City for a while, before moving to Hanoi.

### Academic

I was once a student of the [Programme de Formation d’Ingénieurs d’ Excellence au Vietnam–PFIEV](https://www.francealumni.fr/fr/poste/vietnam/partenaire/8290) at [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City_University_of_Technology), before leaping over and becoming a physics student at [VNU University of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNU_University_of_Science). 

At the moment, I am a part of Dr [Hung Q. Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=L_NTUcoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)'s quantum information & quantum computing research team.

### Outreach

I am serving my first term as the Head of Academic Affairs at [HUS Physics Club](https://husphysicsclub.org). We create engaging physics-related activities, build coherent communities, and promote the love for physics.
