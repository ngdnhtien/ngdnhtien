My name is Nguyễn Đình *Tiến* (goes like *Tee-ian*, but really fast). I was born in [Huế](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huế) and raised in [Bình Dương](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thủ_Dầu_Một). I lived in Sài Gòn for a while before moving to Hà Nội. The majority of my friends believe I speak a mixture of Southern-Northern accents, though my active vocabulary spans the three regions.

As part of [Hung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=L_NTUcoAAAAJ)’s group, my research interests centre around cQED architecture for quantum information processing, specifically high-dimensional control and characterization of superconducting transmon circuits. 

I recently took a drift into the realm of quantum error correction where I study how a potential bosonic code based on odd rotational symmetry can be constructed as a visiting student in the group of [Valerio Scarani](https://sites.google.com/site/valeriosgroup/group-members?authuser=0).
