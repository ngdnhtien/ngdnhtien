Hi there! My name is Nguyễn Đình Tiến, thanks for stopping by. If you’re not falimiar with Vietnamese pronounciation, simply call me *Heisenberg* – that’s just fine. 

I was born in Hue, and raised in Binh Duong. I lived in Ho Chi Minh City for a while, before moving to Hanoi.

### Academic

I was once a student of the [Programme de Formation d’Ingénieurs d’ Excellence au Vietnam–PFIEV](https://www.francealumni.fr/fr/poste/vietnam/partenaire/8290) at [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City_University_of_Technology), before leaping over and become a physics major at [VNU University of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNU_University_of_Science). 

At the moment, I'm a research intern at [Nano and Energy Center](https://nec-hus.edu.vn). My current fields of research are quantum computing, quantum information theory, quantum algorithms.

### Outreach

I am serving my first term as the Head of Academic Affairs at [HUS Physics Club](https://husphysicsclub.org). We create engaging physics-related activities, build coherent communities, and promote the love for physics.

I listen to Coldplay and read Haruki Murakami. When I'm not doodling equations or coding, you may find me playing guitar or reading a book at one of those The Coffee House stores.
